# Android Trivia App

The Android Trivia app is the third project I developed as part of the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course by Udacity. This app challenges users with a series of trivia questions that they must answer correctly to win the game. Throughout the development of this app, I gained valuable experience in implementing navigation, animations, drawable menus, and various other functionalities.

## Project Overview
The Android Trivia app provided an opportunity for me to dive deeper into Android app development and explore advanced features. It focused on creating an engaging quiz experience with interactive elements and user feedback.

## Features
- Multiple-choice trivia questions for users to answer.
- Interactive UI elements to provide an engaging quiz experience.
- Navigation between different quiz sections and end screen.
- Animations to enhance the user interface and experience.
- Drawable menus for accessing additional features and options.
