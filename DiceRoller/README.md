# Dice Rolling App

This is a simple dice rolling app created as part of my Android development learning journey. The app allows you to simulate rolling a dice by clicking a button, and it displays a random dice value on the screen. The app was built using six dice images, and each click generates a random dice value.

## Project Overview
The Dice Rolling App is the first project I developed as part of the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course by Udacity. It served as an introduction to Android app development and helped me understand the basics of creating interactive user interfaces and handling user input.

## Features
- Clicking the "Roll" button simulates rolling the dice.
- Each roll displays a random dice value on the screen.
