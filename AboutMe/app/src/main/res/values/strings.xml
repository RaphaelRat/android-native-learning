    <string name="bio" >Hello, my name is Raphael Abreu.
\n\nI love to code, play guitar, stay with my fiance, play with my neighbors\' cats and read some intresting books.
\n\nAs a Computer Engineering student, I build some devices that involve both hardware and software to do something interesting, like once I made an app to remotely monitor and water your plants.
\n\nBeing in nature is my passion and I really appreciate good times barefoot in the woods or even on the grass.
\n\nFortunately, I like cooking and best of all, I love my food, so I have no problem spending hours preparing everything I like.\n</string>
