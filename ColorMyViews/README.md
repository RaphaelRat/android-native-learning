 # Color My Views App

This repository contains the Color My Views app, which is the third project I developed as part of the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course by Udacity. The app features a set of boxes that change color when clicked, along with buttons at the bottom corner that change the color of specific boxes. There are a total of 5 boxes and 3 buttons. Additionally, clicking anywhere on the app's background also changes its color.

## Project Overview
The Color My Views app allowed me to explore creating interactive user interfaces and handling user interactions in Android development. It focused on implementing click events and dynamically changing the color properties of various UI elements.

## Features
- Clicking on a box changes its color.
- Buttons at the bottom corner change the color of specific boxes.
- Clicking anywhere on the app's background changes its color.
